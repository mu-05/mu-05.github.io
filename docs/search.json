    "text": "3 Wholesale Net Revenue\nHow much revenue comes from business (wholesale) sales? To answer this first question, I wrote an SQL query using a GROUP BY clause, an aggregate function, and a subquery.\nThe results (see Table 2) show that between June and August 2021, approximately 56% of AliMoto Supplies’ revenue came from sales to business customers, while the remaining 44% came from retail customers.\n-- Calculate net revenue and revenue share for each client type\nSELECT client_type, \n1       SUM(total - ROUND(total * payment_fee, 2)) AS net_revenue,\n2       SUM(total - ROUND(total * payment_fee, 2)) / (\n          SELECT SUM(total - ROUND(total * payment_fee, 2))\n            FROM sales\n          ) AS revenue_share\n  FROM sales \n GROUP BY client_type;\n\n1\n\nTotal revenue earned from each client type, after subtracting payment fees from each order.\n\n2\n\nThe percentage of total net revenue that comes from each client type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Net revenue and revenue share for each client type\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis 12 % difference in revenue share, equivalent to $31,883, is likely due to the larger order sizes placed by business customers (see Figure 1). Because they work on multiple vehicles, businesses tend to purchase motorcycle parts in greater quantities, resulting in higher total order values compared to individual retail customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Average quantity ordered by client type. Business customers order, on average, five times more parts than retail customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving determined that 56% of net revenue comes from business customers, the next step is to explore how this wholesale revenue evolves month-to-month and across different warehouse locations."

    "text": "4 Monthly Revenue Growth Across Warhouses\nTo analyze the evolution of wholesale revenue, I began by writing an SQL query to prepare the data. This involved filtering for wholesale transactions, extracting the month from the transaction date, and calculating the net total per transaction. I then aggregated this dataset to calculate the monthly net revenue by warehouse, as shown in Table 3.\n-- Step 1: Create a temporary table of wholesale sales\n-- Adds month information and calculates net total (after payment fee)\nWITH sales_wholesale_revenue AS(\n  SELECT warehouse,\n         date,\n1         CAST(strftime('%m', date) AS INT) AS month_int,\n2         CASE strftime('%m', date)\n                WHEN '06' THEN 'June'\n                WHEN '07' THEN 'July'\n                WHEN '08' THEN 'August'\n         END AS month_chr,\n         total,\n         payment_fee,\n3         total - ROUND(total * payment_fee, 2) AS net_total\n    FROM sales\n   WHERE client_type = 'Wholesale'\n)\n\n-- Step 2: Summarize net revenue by warehouse and month\nSELECT warehouse,\n       month_chr,\n       SUM(net_total) AS net_revenue\n  FROM sales_wholesale_revenue\n GROUP BY warehouse, month_int, month_chr\n ORDER BY warehouse, month_int;\n\n1\n\nExtract the month number from the transaction date for chronological sorting.\n\n2\n\nDerive the full month name from the month number for readability.\n\n3\n\nCalculate each transaction’s total after deducting payment fees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Monthly net revenue by warehouse\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo visualize trends more clearly, I created a line plot of monthly revenue by warehouse (see Figure 2). This revealed three key insights:\n\nHigher Average Revenue in Central and North Warehouses From June to August, the Central and North warehouses generated significantly higher average monthly revenue ($26,000 and $19,200, respectively) compared to the West warehouse ($7,500).\nStrong Growth in Central and North Warehouses Between July and August, net revenue in Central and North warehouses increased by an average of 33%.\nDecline in West Warehouse Performance In contrast, the West warehouse experienced a decline in net revenue, with an average decrease of 13% per month since June.\n\nThese findings indicate that overall net revenue growth from business customers is being held back by the underperformance of the West warehouse. Improving operations or marketing efforts in this location may help boost total wholesale revenue moving forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Net Revenue Trends Across Warehouses. Central and North warehouses show strong growth, while West declines steadily."

However, before allocating these resources, the Ministry is seeking to better understand disparities in pass rates across regions, as well as potential variations by gender and education track.\nTo support this effort, the Ministry has commissioned our data analytics company to develop a user-friendly Power BI dashboard that visualizes the results of the 2023 and 2024 baccalaureate sessions. This tool is intended to help the non-technical funding team easily explore and understand patterns in success rate across France."

There were no missing values, formatting issues or duplicates. However, to reduce redundancy in the original flat file, the data was restructured into two separate datasets:\n\nGeographical dataset: includes information of French departments.\nSuccess rate dataset: contains annual baccalaureate pass rates.\n\nThis separation improves the maintainability and scalability of the project. It makes it easier to update the dashboard with new data and to fix or improve it when needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Simplified data model showing the relationship between departments and pass rates datasets\n\n\n\n\n\nPower Query was used to import and clean the data. This involved selecting appropriate data types and formats for each field, as well as creating new variables, such as a hierarchical structure2 linking departments to regions.\nThe data model3 is based on a simple one-to-many relationship: each record in the departments table corresponds to one or more records in the pass_rates table. This structure supports the multiple years of data (2023 and 2024) included in the dataset."

This allows decision-makers to track trends and identify regions or groups that may have improved or declined.\nOverall Pass Rate (Card Visual)  Displays the average national pass rate across all students and regions, serving as a national performance indicator.\nPass Rates by Gender (Multi-row Card)  Breaks down average pass rates for male and female students, offering a quick way to compare gender-based performance and spot any disparities.\nGeographical Distribution (Filled Map)  Illustrates regional and departmental pass rates using a red-to-green color gradient. This helps identify areas that may require more support or intervention.\nPass Rates by Track and Gender (Clustered Column Chart)  Breaks down the average pass rate by education track (general, technological, vocational) and gender. This helps highlight how different educational paths perform and whether gender plays a role within each track.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Screenshot of the baccalaureate exam results dashboard\n\n\n\n\n\nAll visuals in the dashboard are interactive and connected.

    "text": "4 Key findings\nThe goal of this report is to provide clear, actionable insights to support funding decisions aimed at reducing disparities in baccalaureate pass rates. By analyzing the dashboard visuals, three key data-driven findings emerge:\n\nRegional disparities: Île-de-France underperforms  In 2024, the Île-de-France region recorded the lowest average pass rate at 87.1% (Map Visual), while the national average was 90.8% (Card Visual) – a trend also observed in 2023. A closer look reveals two departments in this region that may require additional support:\n\nVal-d’Oise: 83.8% pass rate\nSeine-Saint-Denis: 85.2% pass rate\n\nGender gaps are more pronounced in specific departments  In both Val-d’Oise and Seine-Saint-Denis, female students outperform male students by an average of 7% (Multi-row Card). This is more than twice the national gender gap, approximately 3%, suggesting that gender-based performance differences are more severe in these departments.\nUnderperformance concentrated in vocational and technological tracks  Vocational and technological tracks are the main contributors to the overall underperformance in Val-d’Oise and Seine-Saint-Denis (Clustered Column Chart). In particular, male students enrolled in these tracks have pass rates below 85%, highlighting a critical area for targeted intervention.\n\nWatch the short demonstration video below to learn how to use the dashboard to discover these insights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Video on how to navigate the dashboard and extract insights"
