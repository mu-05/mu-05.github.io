    "text": "3 Wholesale Net Revenue\nHow much revenue comes from business (wholesale) sales? To answer this first question, I wrote an SQL query using a GROUP BY clause, an aggregate function, and a subquery.\nThe results (see Table¬†2) show that between June and August 2021, approximately 56% of AliMoto Supplies‚Äô revenue came from sales to business customers, while the remaining 44% came from retail customers.\n-- Calculate net revenue and revenue share for each client type\nSELECT client_type, \n1       SUM(total - ROUND(total * payment_fee, 2)) AS net_revenue,\n2       SUM(total - ROUND(total * payment_fee, 2)) / (\n          SELECT SUM(total - ROUND(total * payment_fee, 2))\n            FROM sales\n          ) AS revenue_share\n  FROM sales \n GROUP BY client_type;\n\n1\n\nTotal revenue earned from each client type, after subtracting payment fees from each order.\n\n2\n\nThe percentage of total net revenue that comes from each client type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable¬†2: Net revenue and revenue share for each client type\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis 12 % difference in revenue share, equivalent to $31,883, is likely due to the larger order sizes placed by business customers (see Figure¬†1). Because they work on multiple vehicles, businesses tend to purchase motorcycle parts in greater quantities, resulting in higher total order values compared to individual retail customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Average quantity ordered by client type. Business customers order, on average, five times more parts than retail customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving determined that 56% of net revenue comes from business customers, the next step is to explore how this wholesale revenue evolves month-to-month and across different warehouse locations."

    "section": "4 Monthly Revenue Growth Across Warhouses",
    "text": "4 Monthly Revenue Growth Across Warhouses\nTo analyze the evolution of wholesale revenue, I began by writing an SQL query to prepare the data. This involved filtering for wholesale transactions, extracting the month from the transaction date, and calculating the net total per transaction. I then aggregated this dataset to calculate the monthly net revenue by warehouse, as shown in Table¬†3.\n-- Step 1: Create a temporary table of wholesale sales\n-- Adds month information and calculates net total (after payment fee)\nWITH sales_wholesale_revenue AS(\n  SELECT warehouse,\n         date,\n1         CAST(strftime('%m', date) AS INT) AS month_int,\n2         CASE strftime('%m', date)\n                WHEN '06' THEN 'June'\n                WHEN '07' THEN 'July'\n                WHEN '08' THEN 'August'\n         END AS month_chr,\n         total,\n         payment_fee,\n3         total - ROUND(total * payment_fee, 2) AS net_total\n    FROM sales\n   WHERE client_type = 'Wholesale'\n)\n\n-- Step 2: Summarize net revenue by warehouse and month\nSELECT warehouse,\n       month_chr,\n       SUM(net_total) AS net_revenue\n  FROM sales_wholesale_revenue\n GROUP BY warehouse, month_int, month_chr\n ORDER BY warehouse, month_int;\n\n1\n\nExtract the month number from the transaction date for chronological sorting.\n\n2\n\nDerive the full month name from the month number for readability.\n\n3\n\nCalculate each transaction‚Äôs total after deducting payment fees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable¬†3: Monthly net revenue by warehouse\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo visualize trends more clearly, I created a line plot of monthly revenue by warehouse (see Figure¬†2). This revealed three key insights:\n\nHigher Average Revenue in Central and North Warehouses From June to August, the Central and North warehouses generated significantly higher average monthly revenue ($26,000 and $19,200, respectively) compared to the West warehouse ($7,500).\nStrong Growth in Central and North Warehouses Between July and August, net revenue in Central and North warehouses increased by an average of 33%.\nDecline in West Warehouse Performance In contrast, the West warehouse experienced a decline in net revenue, with an average decrease of 13% per month since June.\n\nThese findings indicate that overall net revenue growth from business customers is being held back by the underperformance of the West warehouse. Improving operations or marketing efforts in this location may help boost total wholesale revenue moving forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: Net Revenue Trends Across Warehouses. Central and North warehouses show strong growth, while West declines steadily."
