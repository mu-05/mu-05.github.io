    "text": "Full Story\n\nAbout Me\nI hold a Masterâ€™s in Applied Economics and Statistics from the University of Lorraine. Most recently, I worked with financial data at CACEIS and SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale, focusing on transaction analysis, data cleaning, and dashboard reporting. These roles strengthened my skills in SQL, Access, and statistical tools, while deepening my passion for making data accessible and actionable.\n\n\nSkills & Tools\n\nProgramming & Data: R, SQL, Excel, Access, VBA\n\nAnalysis: Descriptive & inferential statistics, data cleaning\n\nVisualization & Reporting: Power BI, R Shiny, dashboards, presentations\n\n\n\nProjects & Highlights\n\nSales Performance Analysis\n\nChallenge: A company needed actionable insights into sales performance, broken down by product line and warehouse.\n\nWhat I Did: Used SQL to clean and transform messy datasets, then applied R and ggplot2 to visualize sales trends.\n\nImpact: Discovered a revenue decline in a specific warehouse and delivered recommendations that helped the team take corrective action.\n\n\n\nProcess Optimization & Collaboration\n\nAutomated Excel and Access macros, improving data quality and efficiency.\n\nEnhanced SQL queries to include new fields, expanding reporting capabilities.\n\nCollaborated with colleagues on form design and procedure documentation, making workflows more accessible and consistent.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Iâ€™m Looking For\nIâ€™m seeking a data analyst role where I can apply statistics and programming (R or Python) to solve real-world problems. Iâ€™m especially interested in marketing, sales, or user behavior data.\nI thrive at the intersection of technical analysis and communication, helping teams turn data into actionable strategies. While I enjoy being on-site, Iâ€™m also open to remote opportunities.\n\n\nBeyond Data\nOutside of work, I enjoy playing video games (Persona 5 Royal, God of War) and taking walks in the park â€” especially in winter, my favorite season. Iâ€™m also a big fan of movies like Inception and Jackie Brown, which inspire me with their immersive worlds and memorable characters.\nIâ€™m naturally curious, and that curiosity drives my growth. Right now, Iâ€™m sharpening my Power BI skills to keep building more effective and impactful dashboards.\n\n\nLetâ€™s Connect\nTake a look at my portfolio to see projects that highlight both my technical expertise and communication skills.\nIf youâ€™d like to get in touch, connect with me on LinkedIn or send me a message via the contact form. Iâ€™m open to new opportunities and short-term projects â€” and always happy to discuss how I can help your team make better data-driven decisions."
